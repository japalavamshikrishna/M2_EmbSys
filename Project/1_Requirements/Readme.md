# An Automated Irrigation System 

# Abstract

Arduino Based Automatic Plant Watering System is
proposed in (Devika et al., 2014) where the authors developed the
Arduino microcontroller used to control two functional components
which are the moisture sensors and the motor/water pump to
automatically water the plant. The moisture sensorâ€™s function is to
sense the level of moisture in the soil whereas the water pump supplies
water to the plants.

# Introuduction:

Freshwater is needed for crop and energy production, industrial
fabrication as well as human and ecosystem needs. According to
AQUASTAT database (AQUASTAT, 2016), 69% of the total extracted
freshwater is used by agriculture sector, whereas 19% is used by
industrial sector and the rest in used by domestic segment. Therefore,
water can be considered as a critical need in agriculture sector for
future global food security However, continued increase in demand
for water by domestic and industrial sectors and greater concerns
for environmental quality have create a challenge to every country
to reduce the farm water consumption and sustain the fresh food
requirement  Consequently, there is an urgent need
to create strategies based on science and technology for sustainable use
of water. Industrialist and researchers are working to build efficient
and economic automatic systems to control water usage in order to
reduces much of the wastage.Irrigation is an artificial application of watering the land for
agricultural production. The requirement of water to the soil depends
on soil properties such as soil moisture and soil temperature. Effective
irrigation can influence the entire growth process and automation in
irrigation system using modern technology can be used to provide
better irrigation management. In general, most of the irrigation
systems are manually operated. These traditional techniques can be
replaced with automated techniques of irrigation in order to use the water efficiently and effectively. Conventionally, farmers will present
in their fields to do irrigation process. Nevertheless, nowadays
farmers need to manage their agricultural activity along with other
occupations. A sensor based automated irrigation system provides
promising solution to farmers where the presence of a farmer in
field is not compulsory during irrigation process.

# Objectives
The mai objective of Automated irrigation system is to help farmers that will enable them to control watering the farm and alert them in critical situations.

# 4W's And 1H

# Who
